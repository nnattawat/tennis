# Tennis
Implementation of a tennis game. I only make it into a gem format because it is the easiest way to setup and run the program.

## Setup
You can either run `bin/setup` or `bundle`.

## Usage
You can run the program with `bin/console`.

Example program's interface is in `spec/tennis_spec.rb`.

Run `rake spec` to run all specs.
